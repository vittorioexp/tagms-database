%Notice that, the description here, although rich, is at high level.

A major international food and beverage company is investing in a new set of technologies to increase profits.
The company produces and distributes an average of X products every year, including drinks, juices, beers and snacks of various kinds.

The company's goal is to develop a new information management system that will help reduce excess and shortages of inventory. Furthermore, it is required to keep in memory as much information as possible about the commercial activity so that it is also possible to make analytics to monitor sales and expenses. In this system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item technical employees manage products in the inventory, invoices, and employees;
    \item sellers, on the other hand, have to deal with customers, orders, shipments, and payments;
    \item managers are in charge of managing suppliers, contracts and items;
    \item data analysts have access to the acquired data for inventory, cost and profit analysis;
    \item a system administrator will be responsible for managing the access privileges for each user on the system.
\end{itemize}

Each type of user has a device available to access the system. Depending on the department to which you belong, the appropriate functions will be made available. The system administrator has the task of managing the various employee logs, checking that each of them does not access any functions that are not allowed. In addition, he will take care of any system crashes.

The technical employees has the task of managing the production of the individual products. He will therefore be responsible for the life cycle of each individual product. Like other types of employees, he is characterized by an identification and a badge which allows for simplified personnel management. Another responsibility of him is to provide for the maintenance of the machinery, informing the manager in case there are problems of a technical nature.

Do we need to enter customers? What attributes do they have? What do we store in the table made up of all customers?
A final important function of the seller is to create the user profile when he proceeds with an order, so that it can be uniquely identified within the system. This profile is created only during the first time of purchase. The user's personal data is stored, which will then be used, for example, for the shipment of products by courier. The company, by memorizing these customers and the orders placed, is therefore able to conduct analyzes based on these two variables.

The figure of the Manager is important for the management of relationships (and therefore of contracts) with suppliers. The latter are intended to supply raw materials to the company. For example, if the company produces sugary drinks, suppliers will provide ingredients such as sugars, additives, artificial colors, water and natural flavors. In addition to these elements, there will be suppliers who will provide different types of packaging, such as glass, aluminum latins, or double corrugated cardboard boxes. Suppliers must be registered in the system, along with their name and contact details. Managers stipulate and maintain contracts with suppliers. These contracts are characterized by the following parameters: type of contract, duration of the contract, monetary agreement, quantity requested, and an identification for both the supplier and the raw material the first provides. It will therefore be possible for managers to inspect, for example through a list, all the contracts stipulated with the different suppliers. Furthermore, through the identification of the raw materials, managers have the possibility to filter contracts based on the type of product. Therefore, it is possible that the company can purchase the same type of product from different suppliers. Contracts stipulated between managers and suppliers are of different types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Joint venture;
    \item Partnership;
    \item Collaboration-type network agreement;
    \item Network contract for joint operation.
\end{itemize}
Managers therefore work closely with suppliers and also with sellers. In fact, these 2 relationships allow the data analyst to optimize profits and limit losses. The data analyst has the task of carrying out some analyzes on the internal data of the company to allow the latter to reduce the products that will be in excess (for example because they have expired) and keep under control the minimum quantities for each single product in the warehouse. By periodically carrying out checks on the expiration date of the products in the database, the data analyst is able to find how many expired products are left in stock. The frequency on which this type of control is carried out will be in line with company policies. It is therefore possible that the company decides to carry out this check every quarter. In this case, at the end of the 3 months, the data analyst will carry out his analyzes, communicating the results to the managers through reports. In this way, in the event that the number of products discarded because expired is high, it will be the responsibility of the manager to reduce the quantities of raw materials purchased from the different suppliers. Furthermore, each product is characterized by a minimum quantity of stock in the warehouse. In the event that the number of products discarded is high, the manager will proceed with the decrease of this minimum quantity in stock, in such a way as to minimize losses. In the opposite case in which the number of orders is very high, it is possible that the quantities of some products are zeroed. In this scenario, the figure of the seller will be responsible for communicating this deficiency through a report to the managers. The latter will modify the contract with the suppliers linked to the production of these products, increasing the quantity to be purchased. Furthermore, the seller will be responsible for managing the relationship with the customer, proposing either to wait for new products to be made and then make a single order or to buy what remains in the warehouse and later make a second order. However, it is important to underline that the stock inside the warehouse will be periodically checked by the data analyst, in order to make up for any quantity shortages of some products. In both cases, therefore, the figure of the manager is of primary importance. In fact, it is he who, by decreasing or increasing (according to company policies)
the quantities of raw materials purchased by suppliers, positively affects the total profit of the company.
Furthermore, the data analyst, by inspecting the database, is able to provide order trends based, for example, on the status of the order. He will then be able to provide managers with sales trends within a certain period of interest, so that they can carry out market analyzes.

The figure of the seller is important instead as it is the one who relates to the customer. In fact, he is in charge of interfacing with the customer and receiving the different orders. Before placing the order in the system (database), the seller will have the task of checking the actual stock of the products concerned. As explained above, he is in close contact with the manager to make up for any shortcomings. Assuming that the quantity of stock in question is sufficient, the seller will create a new order within the database. Each order, in addition to being characterized by a timestamp also useful for future analyzes, is characterized by a status, with which it is monitored throughout the production and shipping cycle. Once the order is confirmed, the customer has a limited period (established following the company policies) to make the payment through an external payment system. If the customer proceeds with the payment within the set period, the external system will notify the manager, the order will progress and the customer will receive a notification from the company containing the invoice. In the event that the payment has not been made within this period, the order will be canceled. The company also offers the possibility to cancel the order only if the customer has not made the payment. If this happens, the order is marked as canceled. If everything is successful, the manager takes care of creating (also in this case through an external shipping system) a new shipment, advancing the order status once again. By creating the shipment, the manager will receive a unique code, which will be communicated to the customer so that he can check in detail the status of the order. In the event that the shipment is successful, the order will be considered successful. If, on the other hand, the package is lost or damaged, it will be the responsibility of the manager to manage the practice for the restoration to the company responsible for the transport, and then finally create a new order to be sent back to the customer.

The company produces different types of food products such as snacks or drinks. These products are stored in the database so that it is possible to view all the products that are in production. Furthermore, within this list it is possible to view products that are not currently in production. This is a direct consequence of the company's policy of minimizing losses. In fact, if from the analyzes carried out by the data analyst it emerges that some products do not bring an acceptable profit, the manager proceeds to decrease their production until eventually stopping it definitively. WHAT A PRODUCT IS CHARACTERIZED BY [Each product will therefore be distinguished by an identifier and its nutritional characteristics.] If the company, after in-depth analysis, believes that the product is no longer to be marketed, then it will be removed from this list. In general, the products are made by the company starting from raw materials, which are managed by the managers.

The inventory represents the warehouse of products and items. Information such as the quantity produced and the expiry date will be stored for each product. This date represents an important data as it will be the subject of studies by data analysts. When a seller has successfully concluded the sale of one or more products, he will be in charge of modifying the quantities of the products in question within the database. The same goes for the items, that is the raw materials. However, these are managed solely by the manager, who coordinates purchases with suppliers through contracts. It is important to underline that, based on company policies, minimum quantities will be decided for each product marketed. This strategy, together with the analyzes conducted by data analysts, will lead the company to optimize shipping times.

The items represent the rhyming materials necessary for the final production of the products. These items are managed directly by the managers, who, through contracts with suppliers, decide the quantities to be purchased. For company policies, the same item can be purchased by several companies in such a way as to encourage competition. Also in this case the data analysts, examining the purchases made by the managers, can conduct analyzes to optimize the company's expenses. As in the case of products, the items are also stored in a memory structure so that the manager has a general look at what raw materials are available.

A customer should be able to register to a website in order to search for products to buy, view and manage its orders, and to write reviews -- made of a rating and some comments -- about products. Upon registering, it must specify its name, contact details, and delivery address. The customer receives an invoice with all the details when it places an order and can track it with a dedicated tracking number provided when the shipment is assigned to the courier. The factory shall keep track of all the payments made by customers, along with information about what payment method has been used. To ensure small orders to be evaded in an efficient manner, some products can be produced in advance, which means that the inventory should have a little stock of them, acting as a ``buffer''. If instead an order requires more products than how many are already in stock, the first is held pending until the requested goods are manufactured and packaged for
the shipping.

In the inventory, items are stored with name, relative quantity, and expiration date. In particular, when there is a shortage of one or more items, the supplier providing it will be immediately notified with an automatic e-mail. Also, when a product is manufactured but has not been purchased yet, it should be stored in
the inventory as well, with name, quantity, and expiration date. When a shipment that contains a specific product leaves the factory, the latter must be deleted from the inventory. Of course, products -- as well as items -- that are expired, must be removed from the inventory as soon as possible and disposed of, as they cannot be sold anymore.

%In the described system, the manufacturing and shipment of products is performed by simple workers, who are supervised by a manager. The latter is also responsible for finding and making agreements with suppliers for the replenishment of the inventory. Another important figure is the salesman, which is responsible for interacting with customers, advertising products and ensure that they are satisfied. In the end, there is the analyst, which is in charge of performing analyses and predictions on various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as revenues, generated income for each product, and products rating, in order to determine which are the popular products and, on the contrary, which of them should be decommissioned. Each employee must be registered in the system with name, surname, contact details, the department in which he or she is working, and his or her role.
