A major international food and beverage company is investing in a new set of technologies to increase profits.
The company produces and distributes an average of X products every year, including drinks, juices, beers and snacks of various kinds.

The company's goal is to develop a new information management system that will help reduce excess and shortages of inventory.
Furthermore, it is required to keep in memory as much information as possible about the commercial activity so that
it is also possible to make analytics to monitor sales and expenses.

In this system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item technical employees manage products in the inventory, invoices, and employees;
    \item sellers, on the other hand, have to deal with customers, orders, shipments, and payments;
    \item managers are in charge of managing suppliers and contracts;
    \item data analysts have access to the acquired data for inventory, cost and profit analysis;
    \item a system administrator will be responsible for managing the access privileges for each user on the system.
\end{itemize}

The figure of the Manager is important for the management of relationships (and therefore of contracts) with suppliers.
The latter are intended to supply raw materials to the company. For example, if the company produces sugary drinks, suppliers
will provide ingredients such as sugars, additives, artificial colors, water and natural flavors. In addition to these elements, there
will be suppliers who will provide different types of packaging, such as glass, aluminum latins, or double corrugated cardboard boxes.
Suppliers must be registered in the system, along with their name and contact details. Managers stipulate and maintain contracts with suppliers.
These contracts are characterized by the following parameters: type of contract, duration of the contract, monetary agreement, quantity requested,
and an identification for both the supplier and the raw material the first provides. It will therefore be possible for managers to inspect, for example
through a list, all the contracts stipulated with the different suppliers. Furthermore, through the identification of the raw materials, managers have
 the possibility to filter contracts based on the type of product. Therefore, it is possible that the company can purchase the same type of product
 from different suppliers. Contracts stipulated between managers and suppliers are of different types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Joint venture;
    \item Partnership;
    \item Collaboration-type network agreement;
    \item Network contract for joint operation.
\end{itemize}
Managers therefore work closely with suppliers and also with sellers. In fact, these 2 relationships allow the data analyst to optimize profits and limit losses.
The data analyst has the task of carrying out some analyzes on the internal data of the company to allow the latter to reduce the products that will be in excess
(for example because they have expired) and keep under control the minimum quantities for each single product in the warehouse. By periodically carrying out checks
on the expiration date of the products in the database, the data analyst is able to find how many expired products are left in stock. The frequency on which this
type of control is carried out will be in line with company policies. It is therefore possible that the company decides to carry out this check every quarter.
In this case, at the end of the 3 months, the data analyst will carry out his analyzes, communicating the results to the managers through reports. In this way,
in the event that the number of products discarded because expired is high, it will be the responsibility of the manager to reduce the quantities of raw materials
purchased from the different suppliers. Furthermore, each product is characterized by a minimum quantity of stock in the warehouse. In the event that the number of
products discarded is high, the manager will proceed with the decrease of this minimum quantity in stock, in such a way as to minimize losses.
In the opposite case in which the number of orders is very high, it is possible that the quantities of some products are zeroed. In this scenario, the figure of
the seller will be responsible for communicating this deficiency through a report to the managers. The latter will modify the contract with the suppliers linked
to the production of these products, increasing the quantity to be purchased. Furthermore, the seller will be responsible for managing the relationship with the customer,
proposing either to wait for new products to be made and then make a single order or to buy what remains in the warehouse and later make a second order.
However, it is important to underline that the stock inside the warehouse will be periodically checked by the data analyst, in order to make up for any quantity
shortages of some products.
In both cases, therefore, the figure of the manager is of primary importance. In fact, it is he who, by decreasing or increasing (according to company policies)
the quantities of raw materials purchased by suppliers, positively affects the total profit of the company.
Furthermore, the data analyst, by inspecting the database, is able to provide order trends based, for example, on the type of payment used by the customer or
the type of shipment selected. He will then be able to provide managers with sales trends within a certain period of interest, so that they can carry out market analyzes.

A customer should be able to register to a website in order to search for products to buy, view and manage its orders, and to write reviews -- made of a rating and
some comments -- about products. Upon registering, it must specify its name, contact details, and delivery address. The customer receives an invoice with all the
details when it places an order and can track it with a dedicated tracking number provided when the shipment is assigned to the courier. To ensure small orders to
be evaded in an efficient manner, some products can be produced in advance, which means that the inventory should have a little stock of them, acting as a ``buffer''.
If instead an order requires more products than how many are already in stock, the first is held pending until the requested goods are manufactured and packaged for
the shipping. Of course, products -- as well as items -- that are expired, must be removed from the inventory as soon as possible and disposed of, as they cannot be
sold anymore.

In the inventory, items are stored with name, relative quantity, and expiration date. In particular, when there is a shortage of one or more items, the supplier
providing it will be immediately notified with an automatic e-mail. Also, when a product is manufactured but has not been purchased yet, it should be stored in
the inventory as well, with name, quantity, and expiration date. When a shipment that contains a specific product leaves the factory, the latter must be deleted
from the inventory.
