The seller creates a customer profile in the DBMS when he wants to place an order for the first time, so that he can be uniquely identified within the system and that his future orders can be tracked. The seller can communicate the shortage of products in the warehouse through feedback. He also takes care of managing the relationship with the customer, proposing both to wait for the creation of new products and then place a single order, and to buy what remains in stock and then place a second order. The seller communicates with the customer and receive orders. Before placing the order in the DBMS, the seller will have the task of verifying the actual stock of the products concerned. Each order, in addition to being characterized by a creation date, is characterized by a status, with which it is monitored throughout the production and shipping cycle. Once the order is confirmed, the customer has a limited period to make the payment through an external payment system. If the customer makes the payment within the set deadline, the external system will notify the seller and the customer will receive a notification from the company containing the invoice. Otherwise, the order will be canceled. After creating the shipment, the seller will receive a unique code, which will be communicated to the customer so that he can check in detail the status of the order from the courier's website.

The manager is important for managing relationships and contracts with suppliers. These provide the company with raw materials such as sugars, additives, artificial colors, water and natural flavors. In addition to these elements, there will be suppliers who will provide different types of packaging, such as glass, aluminum latins, or double corrugated cardboard boxes.
Suppliers must be registered in the system, along with their name and contact details. Managers enter into and maintain contracts with suppliers. These contracts are characterized by type, duration, monetary agreement, quantity requested and an identification for both the supplier and the raw material supplied.

The data analyst has the task of carrying out some analyzes on the internal data of the company to allow the latter to reduce the products that will be in excess because they have expired and keep under control the minimum quantities for each single product in the warehouse. By periodically carrying out checks on the expiration date of the products in the database, the data analyst is able to provide feedback to managers to reduce waste, on a quarterly basis. In this way, the manager has a way of knowing whether to reduce or increase the quantities of raw materials purchased from the various suppliers. Furthermore, the data analyst, by inspecting the database, is able to provide the progress of the order. You will then be able to provide the managers with the sales trend within a certain period of interest, so that they can carry out market analysis. In fact, if from the analyzes carried out by the data analyst it emerges that some products do not bring an acceptable profit, the manager proceeds to decrease their production until it finally stops. If the company, after a thorough analysis, believes that the product is no longer to be marketed, then it will be removed from this list.

The inventory represents the warehouse of products and items. Information such as the quantity produced and the expiration date will be stored for each product. When a seller has successfully concluded the sale of one or more products, the warehouse manager will be in charge of modifying the quantities of the products in question within the database.

Of course, expired products - as well as items - must be removed from inventory as soon as possible and disposed of, as they can no longer be sold.

If instead an order requires more products than how many are already in stock, the first is held pending until the requested goods are manufactured and packaged for
the shipping.
