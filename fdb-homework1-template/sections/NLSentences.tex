An international food and beverage company is investing in a new set of technologies to increase profits.
The company produces and distributes many products, including drinks, juices, beers and snacks of various kinds.

The company's goal is to develop a new information management system that will help reduce excesses and shortages in the inventory. Furthermore, it is required to keep in memory as much information as possible about the commercial activity so that it is also possible to make analytics to monitor sales and expenses. In this system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item managers are in charge of interacting with suppliers and concluding contracts with them;
    \item sellers have to deal with customers and create orders;
    \item the data analyst has access to the acquired data for inventory, cost and profit analysis;
    \item the system administrator manages the access privileges for each user on the system.
    \item technical employees take care of production and shipments;
\end{itemize}

The manager is important for the management of relationships (and therefore of contracts) with suppliers. These are intended to supply raw materials to the company such as sugars, additives, artificial colors, water, and natural flavors for sugary drinks produced by the company. In addition to these elements, there will be suppliers who will provide different types of packaging, such as glass, aluminum latins, or double corrugated cardboard boxes. Suppliers must be registered in the system, along with their name and contact details. Managers conclude contracts with suppliers. These contracts are characterized by type, duration, monetary agreement, requested quantity, and an identification for both the supplier and the provided raw materials. It will therefore be possible for managers to inspect all the contracts with the different suppliers. Through the identification of the raw materials, managers have the possibility to filter contracts based on the type of purchased material.

The data analyst carries out some analyses on the internal data to identify the expired products, and communicates the results of the analyses to the manager through reports. In this way, if there is a high number of products discarded, the manager might need to reduce the quantities of raw materials purchased from a supplier to minimize excesses. The data analyst, by inspecting the DBMS, will be able to provide order trends which are based, for example, on the status of the order. They will also notify managers with sales trends within a certain period of interest, so that they can carry out market analyses.

Sellers are important because they are the ones who interact with the customer and create orders within the DBMS. Also, they will be responsible for setting up a profile for each customer within the system when they make their first order. Regarding orders, it will be possible to keep track of their status throughout all the process, i.e., from the production to the shipment. If the customer proceeds with the payment, the order will progress and the customer will receive the invoice; otherwise the order will be canceled. The company offers the possibility to cancel the order only if the customer has not made the payment yet and, if this is the case, the order is marked as canceled. If the payment is successful, a worker will receive the order, prepare the products and create a new shipment, advancing the order status once again. In this way, the worker will receive a unique tracking code, which will be communicated to the customer so that they can follow the delivery of requested products. \textbf{If this is successful, the order will be considered successful as well; otherwise, if the package is lost or damaged, it will be marked as failed: the company will create a new order to be sent back to the customer.}

The items, as previously mentioned, are the raw materials the final products are made of. All the different types of items and their quantities are stored within the DBMS. These elements, which are the manager's responsibility, are characterized by a name, an expiration date, a brief description, and the supplier company. Products are stored in the inventory with name, expiration date, a brief description. Furthermore, each product has a minimum quantity of stock in the warehouse, that is, the number of such products that have to be in stock at any time. The manager might need to modify the contract for the supplying of materials in short supply, increasing the quantity to be purchased. The management of the inventory is carried out autonomously when a new order is created, to verify if there are enough products in stock for the order. A periodic check is carried out on the expiration dates, to check if any item or product is expired. The system will reassign the unusable items or products to the expired inventory. The frequency on which this check is carried out will be decided by the manager.

%The objective of the company is to implement an IMS to address overstocking and outages of items. To accomplish this, each item is stored in the system with name, relative quantity, and expiration date. In particular, when there is a shortage of one or more items, the supplier providing it will be immediately notified with an automatic e-mail. Also, when a product is manufactured but has not been purchased yet, it should be stored in the system as well, with name, quantity, and expiration date. When a shipment that contains a specific product leaves the factory, the latter must be deleted from the inventory.\\
%
%Some products can be produced in advance, which means that the inventory should have a little stock of them, acting as a ``buffer'', to be able to evade small orders smoothly. If an order requires more products than how many are already finished, the first is held pending until the requested goods are not manufactured and packaged for the shipping. Of course, products, as well as items, that are expired, must be removed from the inventory as soon as possible as they cannot be sold anymore.\\

%A customer should be able to register to a website in order to search for products to buy, view and manage its orders, and to write reviews -- made of a rating and some comments -- about products. Upon registering, it must specify its name, contact details, and delivery address. The customer receives an invoice with all the details when it places an order and can track it with a dedicated tracking number provided when the shipment is assigned to the courier.
