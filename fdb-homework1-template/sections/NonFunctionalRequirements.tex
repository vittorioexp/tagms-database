\section{Non Functional Requirements}
%Non functional requirements: what other characteristics should the system have, beside functional requirements?
The system should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item allow to store data following the GDPR (e.g., customer data).
    \item be able to work with big amounts of data.
    \item have a back-up to avoid data loss in case of hardware or software malfunctioning
    \item guarantee privacy of the data using authorization and authentication to access the system
    \item Being capable of handling simultaneous access of x1 users;
    \item Guarantee secure and asynchronous processing of transactions along the production pipeline;
    \item Restrict the submission of new entries to the role: salesmen should not be able to access contracts info, technical workers and data analysts should only be able to access data but not to create any new entries, and managers and admins should be able to access and modify any entry in the database;
    \item Efficient automatic creation of new entries when a new order/contract is entered 
    \item Efficient computation of queries such as:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item inbound transactions associated to a certain supplier
    \item outbound transactions associated to a certain customer
   \item set of elements filtered by certain characteristics (filtered research) in the current inventory, as well as in the past transactions
   \item entries submitted of modified by a certain employee
    \end{enumerate}
    \item User-friendly interface for submitting orders or contracts, editing and displaying data
\end{itemize}
