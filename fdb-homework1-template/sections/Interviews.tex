\section{Interviews}
%who are we going to interview in order to obtain the proper information on the system?
%do we interview the final user? the managers? the analysts?

In order to obtain the proper information on the system and to define the requirements that our IMS must have, we had interviewed people in different categories of the systems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Employees (manager, salesman, data analyst and worker) who use the IMS, to understand what services are used every day and improve it to increases the efficiency of the entire systems
    \item Customers who use the platform to make orders, to understand what are their needed and therefore to improve their experience
\end{itemize}
