\section{Interviews}
%who are we going to interview in order to obtain the proper information on the system?
%do we interview the final user? the managers? the analysts?

In order to obtain the proper information on the system and to define the requirements that our IMS must have, we had interviewed people in different categories of the systems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Employees (manager, salesperson, data analyst and worker) who use the IMS, to understand which services are used every day and improve them to increase the efficiency of the entire system.
    \item Customers, to understand what their needs are and therefore to improve their experience.
\end{itemize}
