Inventory is one of the most important aspects of a manufacturing company. Efficient management of inventory is necessary so that excess stock is not stored and customers demands are met. This project aims to provide an efficient Inventory Management System (IMS) for a manufacturing company to accurately identify which and how much stock to order at what time by maintaining an appropriate level of inventory. In other words, each factory should manage its production in an efficient way in order not to waste resources and to avoid overstocking, as well as outages. To do so, an IMS shall be implemented. An IMS should assist all the different phases involving production, that are: orders issued by customers, manufacturing of the final good, and shipment. In particular, the company that makes use of such system can always keep track of item quantities -- in order to hold in stock only the minimum amount, hence optimizing investments --, invoices, and deliveries. Putting all these benefits together, the production is optimized, thus increasing the company revenues.\\
With this system, both the customers will be able to get the product easily and the risk of the seller will be reduced.
