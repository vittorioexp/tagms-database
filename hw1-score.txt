"SCORE: 5.5


COMMENTS ABOUT THE HOMEWORK:

- A folder containing hw1 was expected; it should not be directly in the root of the repository

- The PDF file of your report is missing. I also got compilation errors

- The objectives of the system are quite generic: they somewhat describe what an English institute is but not what it needs from the system. Then, the two general goal (1) and (2)  almost do not concern the English institute and sound as ""manage data""

- It is odd that you list students as actors in the system (NL part) but not as stakeholders

- Funcitonal requirements are a bit confused. They should be a list of operations on the items in the glossary, here you have some sort of grouping and not all the areas of the glossary seem to be covered. 

- I do not understand in which sense ""Scalability: The students split based on their level and age"" is a functional requirement (actually I do not understand the sentence at all)


CONTRIBUTION TO THE HOMEWORK:

- Asma Bakhtiariazad has no commits to the repository. This is severe and could be taken as invalid contribution to the homework, since each team member is expected to commit. 

- Francesco Fasan has few commits to the repository and they seem to be marginal. This is severe and could be taken as invalid contribution to the homework."
