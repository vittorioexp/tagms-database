"SCORE: 5.25


COMMENTS ABOUT THE HOMEWORK:

- The motivation behind the homework is clear, however it is less clear what is the company you are modeling (or working with). From the Natural language section seems to be a company working with beverages. However, a clear definition of the problem in terms of your mini world of interest is a little hard to find -- making it hard to grasp.

- Interviews with stakeholders are too generic and shallow and not reflect what could be the features and needs required for your application

- I am not sure you need to keep an expired inventory. To identify expired items you can simply run a query on the inventory that can look for items with expiration dates that are earlier than a specific one. 

- Functional and non functional requirements are ok.


CONTRIBUTION TO THE HOMEWORK

- The Team Contribution section must be part of the homework (PDF file) and not a separate stand-alone txt document."
