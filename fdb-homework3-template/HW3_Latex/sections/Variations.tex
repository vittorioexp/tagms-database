\section{Variations to the Relational Schema}
%\textcolor{red}{[Describe here variations and/or corrections to the relational schema of the previous homework, if present. Otherwise, report only the relational schema.]}

From the previous homework we have found some typos within the Data Dictionary section. The respective corrections are shown below:
- In Employee the ``Registration\_date\_ID'' attribute has been renamed to ``Registration\_date''.
- In Draws\_from, the description of the ``Lot\_ID" attribute is changed from ``Foreign Key to Lot, Primary key to Lot'' to ``Foreign Key to Lot, Primary key''
- In Ship, the ``Employee\_ID'' attribute is not a serial but a text type. In particular, a new domain called ``taxnumber'' has been defined, to which the Employee entity ID is associated.

Following are reported several clarifications of some choices made during the creation of the DB. The choice to use the data type "numeric" rather than "money" in the price domain is dictated by the company's need to use a more precise decimal notation. In fact, micro price variations may be necessary, which would not be allowed with the "money" type. The company is therefore able to specify a price up to 3 decimal digits. Furthermore, since the company operates only in Italy, the currency used within the system to store the various prices and costs is the euro. Using money, on the other hand, several conversions would have been necessary, as the default currency is in dollars.
