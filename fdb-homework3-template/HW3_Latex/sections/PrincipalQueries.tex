\textcolor{red}{[Write some of the queries to be performed to satisfy your functional requirements. 3-4 queries are enough, try to use the techniques seen at lecture (aggregate functions, group by, subqueries,â€¦)]}

After inserting a new lot with identifier Lot\_id (see the "populate" section), decrease the quantity of the items involved in the production of a lot.

UPDATE tagms.item AS i SET
    quantity = c.quantity
FROM (
    SELECT i.item\_id, i.quantity - l.product\_quantity * m1.quantity AS quantity FROM tagms.lot AS l
        INNER JOIN tagms.made\_up\_of\_1 AS m1 ON l.product\_id = m1.product\_id

        INNER JOIN tagms.item AS i ON m2.item\_id = i.item\_id
    WHERE l.lot\_id = '3'
    ORDER BY item\_id ASC
     )
         AS c(item\_id, quantity)
WHERE c.item\_id = i.item\_id
RETURNING i.item\_id, name, description, i.quantity, minimum\_quantity, item\_category\_id;



After inserting a new contract with identifier Contract\_id, the quantities of items in stock must be incremented in the delivery date.

UPDATE tagms.item AS i SET
    quantity = c.quantity
FROM (
    SELECT i.item\_id, i.quantity + s.purchased\_quantity AS quantity FROM tagms.contract AS c
        INNER JOIN tagms.specify AS s ON c.contract\_id = s.contract\_id

     )
     AS c(item\_id, quantity)
WHERE c.item\_id = i.item\_id
RETURNING i.item\_id, name, description, i.quantity, minimum\_quantity, item\_category\_id;



Lists all available lots (unsold and that won't expire in 6 months) containing a particular product having a given Product\_id as identifier, sorted by expiration date (oldest lots must be sold first).

SELECT l.lot\_id,
       l.expiration\_date AS expiration\_date,
       l.product\_id,
       l.product\_quantity,
       ROUND(l.lot\_price * (1 + l.vat/100) * (1 - l.lot\_discount/100), 2) AS gross\_price
FROM tagms.lot AS l
    LEFT OUTER JOIN tagms.draws\_from AS df ON l.lot\_id = df.lot\_id
WHERE l.product\_id = '6'
  AND l.expiration\_date > (current\_date + interval '6 months')
  AND df.order\_id IS NULL
ORDER BY l.expiration\_date ASC;



Get the net sales and paid taxes in a given time interval.

SELECT SUM(o.net\_price) AS net\_sales, SUM(o.taxes) AS taxes FROM tagms.order AS o
    WHERE DATE(o.order\_date) >= '2021-01-01' AND
          DATE(o.order\_date) <= '2021-12-31' AND
          o.order\_paid = TRUE;



Get the cost of materials in a given time interval.

SELECT SUM(sp.price) AS cost\_of\_material FROM tagms.specify as sp
    INNER JOIN tagms.contract AS c ON c.contract\_id = sp.contract\_id
WHERE c.contract\_date >= '2021-01-01' AND c.contract\_date <= '2021-12-31';




Get the production cost in a given time interval

SELECT SUM(p.production_cost * l.product_quantity) AS production_cost FROM tagms.lot AS l
    JOIN tagms.product AS p ON l.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN tagms.draws_from AS df ON l.lot_id = df.lot_id
    JOIN tagms.order AS o ON df.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE DATE(o.order_date) >= '2021-01-01' AND DATE(o.order_date) <= '2021-12-31';



When inserting an order, the operator can choose a custom price (e.g., decided with the customer)
or use the following query.
Given an order with Order_id, compute the order's net_price and total taxes.
Note: the given Order_id must be written twice in the query

UPDATE tagms.order AS o
SET net_price = tmp.net_price,
    taxes = tmp.taxes
FROM (
         SELECT SUM(l.lot_price * (1 - l.lot_discount / 100)) AS net_price,
                SUM(l.lot_price * l.VAT/100) as taxes
         FROM tagms.draws_from AS df
                  INNER JOIN tagms.lot AS l ON df.lot_id = l.lot_id
        WHERE df.order_id = '2'
    ) AS tmp(net_price, taxes)
WHERE o.order_id = '2'
RETURNING o.order_id, o.net_price, o.taxes;

Note: the given Order\_id must be written twice in the query


When inserting a lot, the operator can choose a custom price or use the following query.Given a lot with Lot_id, compute the lot price
Note: the given Lot_id must be written twice in the query

UPDATE tagms.lot AS l
SET lot_price = tmp.lot_price
FROM (
         SELECT p.production_cost*p.price_increase*l.product_quantity
             AS lot_price FROM tagms.lot AS l
            INNER JOIN tagms.product AS p ON l.product_id = p.product_id
         WHERE l.lot_id = '3'
     ) AS tmp(lot_price)
WHERE l.lot_id = '3'
RETURNING *;

Note: the given Lot\_id must be written twice in the query.



Given an item (which is used to create a product) having Item\_id as identifier and a time interval (actually, two dates), find the total quantity of that item that has been used for production or packaging during that time.

SELECT SUM(l.product\_quantity * m1.quantity) AS quantity FROM tagms.made\_up\_of\_1 AS m1
    INNER JOIN tagms.lot AS l ON m1.product\_id = l.product\_id
    INNER JOIN tagms.draws\_from AS df ON l.lot\_id = df.lot\_id
    INNER JOIN tagms.order AS o ON df.order\_id = o.order\_id
WHERE m1.item\_id = '9'
  AND DATE(o.order\_date) >= '2021-01-01'
  AND DATE(o.order\_date) <= '2021-12-31';



Return the list of items which have stock quantity lower than the minimum one.

SELECT * FROM tagms.item AS i
WHERE i.quantity < i.minimum\_quantity;



Return the list of unsellable lots which are in stock (that will expire in less than 6 months).

SELECT
       l.lot\_id,
       l.expiration\_date AS expiration\_date,
       l.product\_id,
       l.product\_quantity,
       l.package\_id,
       l.package\_quantity,
       l.lot\_discount,
       l.vat,
       l.lot\_price
       FROM tagms.lot AS l
    LEFT OUTER JOIN tagms.draws\_from AS df ON l.lot\_id = df.lot\_id
WHERE l.expiration\_date <= (current\_date + interval '6 months')
  AND df.order\_id IS NULL;
