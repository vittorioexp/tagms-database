\section{Variations to the Relational Schema}
%\textcolor{red}{[Describe here variations and/or corrections to the relational schema of the previous homework, if present. Otherwise, report only the relational schema.]}

From the previous homework we have found some typos within the Data Dictionary section. The respective corrections are shown below:
- In Employee the "Registration_date_ID" attribute has been renamed to "Registration_date".
- In Draws_from, the description of the "Lot_ID" attribute is changed from "Foreign Key to Lot, Primary key to Lot" to "Foreign Key to Lot, Primary key"
- In Ship, the "Employee_ID" attribute is not a serial but a text type. In particular, a new domain called "taxnumber" has been defined, to which the Employee entity ID is associated.
