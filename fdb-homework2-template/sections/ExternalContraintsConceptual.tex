\subsection{External Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item Employees can only insert and modify transactions in their particular department and role (i.e workers assigned in raw materials cannot add finished products transactions)
\item Customers coordinate with Salesmen thus, only Salesmen can create Customers' profile, orders and payment and track status
\end{itemize}
