\subsection{External Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item All the units of measure used by the company are fixed. Furthermore, for sake of simplicity, they are reported in detail in the entity table. All the items stored in the system follow these conventions.
\item Only employees that are sill working in the company can access the system.
\item Only the manager can insert new contracts, so the employee who takes part in the ``stipulate'' relationship must have the role equal to ``Manager''.
\item Only the salesman can insert new orders, so the employee who takes part in the ``place'' relationship must have the role equal to ``Salesman''. Only the salesman can update the order status by changing the attribute "Order\_paid" which by default is set to false.
\item Only the worker can ship orders, so the employee who takes part in the ``ship'' relationship must have the role equal to ``Worker''.
\item A product is made up of one or more items taken from a certain subset, i.e. having a certain ``Item\_Category'' (e.g., ``ingredient'' or ``glass bottle''). Furthermore, a package is made up of one or more items taken from a certain subset, i.e. having a certain ``Item\_Category'' (e.g., ``box'', ``plastic tape'' or ``polystyrene''). As an example, in the list of items there can be both ``Sugar'' and ``Box'', but the former can appear only in relationships with the ``Product'' entity, while the latter only with the ``Package'' entity.
\item An expired lot cannot be sold.
