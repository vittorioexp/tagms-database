\subsection{External Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The company decides the total discount to apply to a specific lot. This discount expresses a percentage and is a number between 0 and 100. Furthermore, the company is able to take into account changes in VAT.
\item The units of measure used by the company are specified in detail in the entity table.
\item Employees can only operate in their own department of competence with the role that belongs to them.
\item Sellers create a profile for new customers. They can also keep track of the order status on their own, also updating the payment status once the bill is settled.
\item Only the Manager can insert new contracts, so the Employee who takes part in the "stipulate" relationship must have the role equal to "Manager". Only the Salesman can insert new orders, so the Employee who takes part in the "place" relationship must have the role equal to "Seller". Only the Worker can ship orders, so the Employee who takes part in the "ship" relationship must have the role equal to "Worker".
\item A product must consist of one or more items all having as Item_Category "ingredient" or "container". A package must consist of one or more items all having as Item_Category "box", "plastic tape", "polystyrene", or "other packaging material". %TODO: container is correct?
\item The quantities of products contained in a lot belong to a finite set (e.g. 25, 50, 100), so the customer cannot order an arbitrary quantity of products.
\item The email addresses provided by customers cannot be changed as they are primary keys.
