\subsection{External Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The units of measure used by the company are specified in detail in the entity table.
\item Only employees that are sill working (i.e. those who have the ``Still\_working'' attribute set to ``True'') in the company can access the system.
\item Only the manager can insert new contracts, so the employee who takes part in the ``stipulate'' relationship must have the role equal to ``Manager''. 
\item Only the salesman can insert new orders, so the employee who takes part in the ``place'' relationship must have the role equal to ``Salesman''. Only the salesman can update the order status by changing the attribute "Order\_paid" which by default is set to false.
\item Only the worker can ship orders, so the employee who takes part in the ``ship'' relationship must have the role equal to ``Worker''.
\item A product is made up of one or more items taken from a given domain, i.e. having a certain ``Item\_Category'' (e.g., ``ingredient'' or ``glass bottle''). A package is made up of one or more items taken from a given domain, i.e. having a certain ``Item\_Category'' (e.g., ``box'', ``plastic tape'' or ``polystyrene'').
\item The quantities of products contained in a lot belong to a finite set (e.g. 25, 50, 100).
\item An expired lot cannot be sold.
\end{itemize}
