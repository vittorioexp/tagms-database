\subsection{External Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item Only employees that are sill working (i.e. those who have the "Still\_working" attribute set to "True") in the company can access the system. So Employees that take part in any operation of insertion or modification must have True as value of attribute Still\_working in its own Employee Relation.
\item Only the Salesman can insert new orders, so the Employee\_ID in the Order relation must have the role equal to "Salesman". Only the Salesman can update the order status.
\item Only the Manager can insert new contracts, so the Employee\_ID of the Contract relation must have the role equal to "Manager".
\item Only the Worker can ship orders, so the Employee\_ID in the Ship relation must have the role equal to "Worker".
\end{itemize}
