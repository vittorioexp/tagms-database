\subsection{External Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item An Employee that stores information about a lot must insert the value decided by the company for the Lot\_discount attribute of Lot Relation. This discount expresses a percentage and is a number between 0 and 100. Analogously for the value of the VAT attribute of Lot Relations, it must be the one decided by the company.
\item Only the Manager can insert new contracts, so the Employee\_ID of the Contract relation must have the role equal to "Manager". 
\item Only the Salesman can insert new orders, so the Employee\_ID in the Order relation must have the role equal to "Salesman". 
\item Only the Worker can ship orders, so the Employee\_ID in the Ship relation must have the role equal to "Worker".
\item A product must consist of one or more items having a certain Item\_Category (e.g., "ingredient" or "glass bottle"). A package must consist of one or more items having a certain Item\_Category (e.g., "box", "plastic tape" or "polystyrene"). 
\item The quantities of products contained in a lot belong to a finite set (e.g. 25, 50, 100), so the customer cannot order a lot with an arbitrary quantity of products. The Product\_Quantity in Lot Relation must be a value of between 25,50,100.
\item An expired lot cannot be sold. If Expiration\_date of a lot in  Lot relation is earlier than the current date, and this lot is not found in Draws\_from relation, it mustn't be  inserted in Draws\_from.
