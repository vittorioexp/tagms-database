\subsection{External Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item An Employee that stores information about a lot must insert the value decided by the company for the Lot\_discount attribute of Lot Relation. This discount expresses a percentage and is a number between 0 and 100. Analogously for the value of the VAT attribute of Lot Relations, it must be the one decided by the company.
\item An Employee that stores information about a product must insert the value decided by the company for the attribute Price\_increase of the Product Relation, according to company policies. Such value must be greater than or equal to 1. The price of a product is calculated as a multiplication between the values of Production\_Cost and Price\_Increase.
\item The value of attribute ("Lot\_price") of Lot Relation is calculated from the value of the product's price of the product identified by Product\_ID, computed as in the previous point and multiplied by its quantity. It is important to underline that the "Lot\_price" attribute cannot be derived through an online operation as the fields on which it depends ("Production\_Cost" and "Price\_increase") can be modified over time and therefore give discordant results at different times.
\item The value of attribute Net\_price of Order Relation $O_j$ must be calculated as the sum, for each lot $L_i$ with its Lot\_ID included in a "Draws from" Relation with Order\_ID corresponding to the one of $O_j$, of the value $ \mathrm{Lot\_price}_i $ * (1 - $ \mathrm{Lot\_discount}_i $ / 100) obtained from its attributes. The total taxes are calculated as the sum, for each lot $L_i$ defined as before, of the value $ \mathrm{Lot\_price}_i $ * $ \mathrm{VAT}_i $ / 100 obtained from its attributes.
\item The units of measure used by the company are specified in detail in the relations.
\item Only employees that are sill working (i.e. those who have the "Still\_working" attribute set to "True") in the company can access the system. So Employees that take part in any operation of insertion or modification must have True as value of attribute Still\_working in its own Employee Relation.
\item Sellers can keep track of the order status on their own, also updating the payment status once the bill is settled. So, employees with Role\_ID of Salesman are able to access orders in the Order Relation that have their ID as value of attribute Employee\_ID, then change the value of the attribute Order\_paid. By default, the boolean "Order\_paid" is false.
\item Only the Manager can insert new contracts, so the Employee\_ID of the Contract relation must have the role equal to "Manager". 
\item Only the Salesman can insert new orders, so the Employee\_ID in the Order relation must have the role equal to "Salesman". 
\item Only the Worker can ship orders, so the Employee\_ID in the Ship relation must have the role equal to "Worker".
\item A product must consist of one or more items having a certain Item\_Category (e.g., "ingredient" or "glass bottle"). A package must consist of one or more items having a certain Item\_Category (e.g., "box", "plastic tape" or "polystyrene"). 
\item The quantities of products contained in a lot belong to a finite set (e.g. 25, 50, 100), so the customer cannot order a lot with an arbitrary quantity of products. The Product\_Quantity in Lot Relation must be a value of between 25,50,100.
\item An expired lot cannot be sold. If Expiration\_date of a lot in  Lot relation is earlier than the current date, and this lot is not found in Draws\_from relation, it mustn't be  inserted in Draws\_from.
