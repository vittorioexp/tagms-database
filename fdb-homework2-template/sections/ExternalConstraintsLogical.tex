\subsection{External Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item An Employee that stores information about a lot must insert the value decided by the company for the Lot\_discount attribute of Lot Relation. This discount expresses a percentage and is a number between 0 and 100. Analogously for the value of the VAT attribute of Lot Relations, it must be the one decided by the company.
\item An Employee that stores information about a product must insert the value decided by the company for the attribute Price\_increase of the Product Relation, according to company policies. Such value must be greater than or equal to 1. The price of a product is calculated as a multiplication between the values of Production\_Cost and Price\_Increase.
\item The value of attribute ("Lot\_price") of Lot Relation is calculated from the value of the product's price of the product identified by Product\_ID, computed as in the previous point and multiplied by its quantity. It is important to underline that the "Lot\_price" attribute cannot be derived through an online operation as the fields on which it depends ("Production\_Cost" and "Price\_increase") can be modified over time and therefore give discordant results at different times.
\item The value of attribute Net\_price of Order Relation $O_j$ must be calculated as the sum, for each lot $L_i$ with its Lot\_ID included in a "Draws from" Relation with Order\_ID corresponding to the one of $O_j$, of the value $ \mathrm{Lot\_price}_i $ * (1 - $ \mathrm{Lot\_discount}_i $ / 100) obtained from its attributes. The total taxes are calculated as the sum, for each lot $L_i$ defined as before, of the value $ \mathrm{Lot\_price}_i $ * $ \mathrm{VAT}_i $ / 100 obtained from its attributes.
\item Only the Manager can insert new contracts, so the Employee\_ID of the Contract relation must have the role equal to "Manager". 
\item Only the Salesman can insert new orders, so the Employee\_ID in the Order relation must have the role equal to "Salesman". 
\item Only the Worker can ship orders, so the Employee\_ID in the Ship relation must have the role equal to "Worker".
\item A product must consist of one or more items having a certain Item\_Category (e.g., "ingredient" or "glass bottle"). A package must consist of one or more items having a certain Item\_Category (e.g., "box", "plastic tape" or "polystyrene"). 
\item The quantities of products contained in a lot belong to a finite set (e.g. 25, 50, 100), so the customer cannot order a lot with an arbitrary quantity of products. The Product\_Quantity in Lot Relation must be a value of between 25,50,100.
\item An expired lot cannot be sold. If Expiration\_date of a lot in  Lot relation is earlier than the current date, and this lot is not found in Draws\_from relation, it mustn't be  inserted in Draws\_from.
